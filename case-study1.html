                standards and expectations, ensuring it accurately reflects the

                <b>Problem:</b> An outdated, inaccessible website that does not

                <b>Constraints:</b>Maintaining the color scheme, limitations of
                a one person team, completing the project before their next

                I kept the design of this website as simple as possible,
                maintaining a "homegrown" feel. As I would also be coding this
                website, I knew the CSS would be a bit exploratory for me, so I
                did not preemptively note down specific font size, header size,
                etc.

            <h2 class="sub-title">Challenges and Solutions:</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-text">
                I initially struggled with maintaining the color scheme (red,
                green, white) in the improved website design. I didn’t want the
                website colors to clash, or give off a “Christmas” vibe. I found
                the material design: Basil, which had a traditional “recipe”
                aesthetic. I tweaked the colors slightly, and I thought this
                really suited the business. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-text">
                I also wanted to use Rosie’s family farm photos, but realized
                that the resolution for most of the images were very low. I
                wanted to maintain the “gritty” look, so I opted not to upscale
                with AI. Instead, I used borders and sizing of the images
                mindfully so they would appear pleasing to the user, but still
                look original and vintage.
            </p>
            <h2 class="sub-title">Learning & takeaways</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-text">
                I learned so much from this experience from utilizing Figma
                components, identifying copyrighted material, to how hosting
                services work (just to name a few!). I truly appreciate all that
                I gained from designing and coding a fully functional website,
                and this experience helped me identify how I would like to grow
                more as a designer. I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, along with
                Git, Github, and navigating a Linux OS.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-text">
                After finishing / launching this website, I decided to better my
                understanding of design fundamentals, and completed Gary Simon's
                Design Course (which I really enjoyed!!)

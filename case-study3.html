            <p class="paragraph-text">
                Creating the Clearview STEM program, I focused on integrating
                student interests, connecting STEM to real-world experiences,
                and fostering engagement through hands-on activities. The
                curriculum aimed to be engaging,enjoyable, and
                technology-driven, introducing students to STEM opportunities.
                Unique to this program was the emphasis on student choice,
                allowing them to explore topics of personal interest, enhancing
                their ownership and investment in learning.
            </p>

                I feel the end product aligns with Clearview’s mission
                statement, and is a reflection of the school’s values.

                <b>Problem:</b> Design and create a STEM program for 8th-grade
                students (ages 11-12) in a school district which lacks a
                dedicated STEM program and basic tools / materials for a
                hands-on oriented curriculum. <br />
                <b>Role:</b> Curriculum designer | Teacher

                <b>Team:</b>Independent <br />
                <b>Constraints:</b>Upon entering the district, there were no
                supplies available (e.g., scissors, glue, microscopes,
                magnifying glasses, rulers, scales). The biggest challenge was
                to create hands-on and engaging lessons with virtually no
                materials to work with. Students were each in possession of
                their own chromebooks.

            <p class="paragraph-text">
                My first step was to gather data, and learn what students care
                about to devise a curriculum that draws their attention. <br />
                I conducted a survey among approximately 600 middle school
                students over the course of one year. The survey included
                questions about their favorite subjects in school and topics
                they were interested in learning about. However, due to privacy
                considerations and ethical guidelines, I am unable to share
                specific survey responses without parental permission.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-text">
                Here is a sample of the survey questions.
            </p>

            <!-- <img
                class="size-images"

                alt="top 3 improvements"
            /> -->

            <p class="paragraph-text">
                Students expressed interest in a wide range of topics, including
                physics, sports, art, computer science, and life science.
                However, they often felt that their interests were not
                integrated into their learning experiences at school.
                Additionally, students expressed a desire to understand how
                these subjects could be relevant to their future aspirations.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-text">
                Based on survey feedback, I acknowledged the wide spectrum of
                student interests, posing a challenge in unifying them into a
                cohesive curriculum. This realization inspired me to include
                exploratory lessons where students select topics of personal
                interest to delve into further. This approach empowers students
                to explore their passions while understanding their relevance to
                the STEM field. Now, I had a vision for the STEM program.

                HTML and CSS into my STEM class. This allows students to
                integrate their personal interests by creating websites on
                topics that intrigue them. Additionally, through teaching
                coding, I aim to instill and reinforce the problem-solving

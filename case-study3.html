                meaningful learning experiences in the real world." - Clearview
                Mission Statement
            </h1>
            <p class="paragraph-text">
                Creating the Clearview STEM program, I focused on integrating
                student interests, connecting STEM to real-world experiences,
                and fostering engagement through hands-on activities. The
                curriculum aimed to be engaging,enjoyable, and
                technology-driven, introducing students to STEM opportunities.
                Unique to this program was the emphasis on student choice,
                allowing them to explore topics of personal interest, enhancing
                their ownership and investment in learning.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-text">
                I feel the end product aligns with Clearview’s mission
                statement, and is a reflection of the school’s values.

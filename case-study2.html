                <b>Problem:</b> In a busy world where people often are caught up
                in their own lives, Art History will provide a simple to use,
                easily accessible, modernized database of historical art
                information. This will provide users with monumental and
                foundational art pieces of humanity, public domain images, and
                biographies. <br />

                I decided to focus on Monet as the artist for this sample. I
                found his work soothing, aesthetic, and intriguing. This was a

            </h1>
            <p class="paragraph-text">
                The next step was to gain user feedback on the original website
                <br />
                I created a survey which I gave to a total of 3 participants.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-text">

                This assured my assumptions while providing insight to how the
                overall design should be. The navigation would be organized so
                that the user has a linear path. This is to reduce the feeling
                of being overwhelmed with information as the website is intended
                to expand as more artists are added to the database. There will
                always be a "search" bar located in the header on every page so
                the user can break this flow if desired.

                My primary challenge was designing a clean and simple layout
                that effectively presented a substantial amount of information.
                I aimed to create a website that would prevent users from
                feeling overwhelmed. To achieve this, I decided to use large
                images as buttons to showcase the artist's artworks. This
                approach allows the content to be organized in a grid format,
                enabling dynamic loading of information onto the user's screen.
                This setup also makes it easy to update the database regularly.

            <p class="paragraph-text">
                I used auto-layout in Figma to implement this feature.

                This project gave me an excellent opportunity to effectively use
                auto-layout. While I had some prior experience with it, creating
                a successful grid system that dynamically adds and removes
                images made me feel much more accomplished in my understanding
                of auto-layout.

                I also conducted multiple user studies during this project,
                which allowed me to engage directly with users. Being better
                prepared for this experience, I gained a confident understanding
                of how to conduct more effective user studies in the future.
